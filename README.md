# Crop Yield Predictor

A machine learning project to predict crop yield based on various agricultural factors such as weather conditions, soil properties, and other environmental variables. This project leverages Python and Jupyter Notebook for analysis and modeling.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Preprocessing of agricultural datasets to clean and prepare the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selection and transformation of key features for improved predictions.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc., to predict crop yields.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of trends and patterns in the data.
- **Prediction**: Accurately predict crop yield based on input parameters.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ravi1215/crop_yield_predictor.git
   cd crop_yield_predictor
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open the crop_yield.ipynb file in your browser.

## Usage
1. Load Dataset: Replace the dataset with your own agricultural data if needed.
2. Run Cells: Execute each cell in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.
3. Input Parameters: Provide input features to the trained model for crop yield prediction.
4. Visualize Results: Check the output graphs and prediction accuracy
